EyeOS - GNU Affero General Public License


## Context

EyeOS was an open source web desktop with many features, released under AGPL.
Actually, the creators of EyeOS decided in September 2011 to change the license of their product to a non-FLOSS one.
Please visit [Wikipedia page for EyeOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeOS) for more details.


As I ([Jon Randoem](https://github.com/jon-randoem/)) downloaded some time ago a version of EyeOS (2.5) that was released under GNU Affero General Public License, I considered releasing it on Github to help the community to take the project back from its FLOSS versions.


I do not consider myself as a maintainer of this project; if you are interested in developing from this version or in becoming the maintainer of the potential future versions of this software, please fork this repository.
I am not affiliated in any kind with the original EyeOS creators.

I did not edit any file from the original package (except this README.md file)

## Version
The version given here (EyeOS 2.5) seems to be the last stable release of FLOSS EyeOS; it was released on May 14, 2011.
Please note that since the change of their license, EyeOS creators also changed their versioning numbers for their proprietary product, which was first released as 1.0.
Again, visit [Wikipedia page for EyeOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeOS) for more details.



## Thanks

Even if they decided to leave the FLOSS model, [creators of EyeOS](http://eyeos.org) made a tremendous job with this software.
Thank you EyeOS team!
